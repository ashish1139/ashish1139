“Bricks-to-clicks”
A brick-to-click business sells goods to customers through multiple channels, one of which is typically an actual store and the other an online store. The brick represents the physical location, and the click represents the e-business. There are two more terms: click-to-mortar and bricks-to-mortar. Only customers who visit physical retail locations are sold products by brick and mortar stores. However, customers of click-and-mortar stores can purchase orders online and have them delivered to the physical, closed location of the same brand (Gepard, n.d.).
In this assignment, I will consider a brick-to-mortar store and explain the transition of this store from bricks-to-clicks. The store will be fully online and my responsibility will be managing its database, securing important data, and developing a mobile shopping application.
Project Proposal: Smart Boutique Store - Expanding to Bricks-to-Clicks
Name of the store: Smart Boutique Store 
Type of the store: Cloth store which has a physical address at Dhaka city and sells cloths on bricks-to-mortar. The store wants to expand its business bricks-to-clicks.
SDLC Approach: Agile Methodology
According to Heuritech (n.d.), digital transformation includes: 
Online and physical retailers should adjust to the needs of today's customers. Enhance the value chain's links, especially the supply chain. Teams in a fashion company should be reorganized and unified. Make current procedures more enduring, discuss contemporary consumer principles like inclusion and transparency. 
SDLC Application (GeeksforGeeks, n.d.):
1.	Planning:
o	Requirements Gathering: Collect detailed requirements from stakeholders, including product features, user experience expectations, and integration with existing systems.
o	Project Scope Definition: Clearly define the scope of the project, including the mobile app's functionality, target audience, and integration with the existing brick-and-mortar store.
2.	Design:
o	User Interface (UI) Design: Create intuitive and visually appealing designs for the mobile app, considering user experience and branding.
o	Database Design: Design a robust database structure to store product information, customer data, orders, and inventory.
3.	Development:
o	Mobile App Development: Develop the mobile app using a suitable framework like React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
o	Integration with Existing Systems: Integrate the mobile app with the store's existing inventory management, payment processing, and customer relationship management systems.
4.	Testing:
o	Unit Testing: Test individual components of the app to ensure they function as expected.
o	Integration Testing: Test the integration of the app with other systems.
o	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve potential customers in testing the app to gather feedback and ensure it meets their needs.
5.	Deployment:
o	Launch the mobile app: Make the app available on app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store).
o	Marketing and Promotion: Promote the app through various channels, including social media, email marketing, and in-store promotions.
6.	Maintenance and Support:
o	Provide ongoing maintenance, updates, and support for the mobile app.
o	Monitor user feedback and make necessary improvements.
Programming Language: 
Python is an open-source, high-level programming language that makes it simple for developers and businesses to create sophisticated enterprise solutions. Web and mobile applications, GUIs, data research, embedded systems, game development, and many other fields can benefit from using Python development services. As a result, it requires a project management strategy that produces unparalleled outcomes (Barot, 2022). 
Technology and process are combined in agile Python development. Agile methods enable Python teams to work much more efficiently and produce outcomes much more quickly. In a word, agile methodology is a project management style that produces high-quality, timely, and functional products; it is not Python-specific.
Requirements:
•	Customer Data Security: Implement robust security measures to protect customer data, including credit card information, shipping and billing addresses, and personal details.
•	Mobile App Development: Develop a user-friendly mobile app with features like product browsing, shopping cart, checkout, order tracking, and push notifications.
•	Database Management: Manage the store's database efficiently to store product information, customer data, orders, and inventory.
•	Integration with Existing Systems: Integrate the mobile app with the store's point-of-sale (POS) system, inventory management system, and different payment gateway.
•	Marketing and Promotion: Develop a marketing strategy to promote the mobile app and attract new customers.
GitHub Repository: 
This project proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to expanding the Smart Boutique Store's business to bricks-to-clicks using an Agile SDLC methodology and leveraging the power of mobile technology. By following these steps and addressing the identified requirements, the store can successfully reach a wider customer base and drive growth.
